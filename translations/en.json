    "title": "Developed Where It's Used",
    "description": "MediSkill was founded by Martin Lawaetz, specialist in vascular surgery. Inspired by gaps during his own training, it started as a local project and is now a fully functional digital tool. It has been developed and tested in the real everyday environment where doctors work. It has been important not to be just another documentation burden, but to be a tool that actually helps, makes documentation easier, and results in something that can be used concretely in daily practice.",
